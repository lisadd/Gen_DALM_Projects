/* Develop Code by Using a Compute Instance
When using a notebook for custom model training, you typically connect to a compute instance (e.g., a virtual machine or a managed compute environment like Azure Machine Learning compute instances or AWS SageMaker instances). The following example shows a basic setup using common libraries. */


# Develop Code by Using a Compute Instance - Example Logistic Regression:

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Load data (replace with your actual data source)
data = pd.read_csv("your_data.csv")

# Prepare features (X) and target (y)
X = data.drop("target_column", axis=1)
y = data["target_column"]

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train a model
model = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear')
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("Model training complete on the compute instance.")
