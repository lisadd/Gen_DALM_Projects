Steps to set up query federation for Redshift (see https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/query-federation/redshift):

A. Create a Connection:
In Databricks Catalog Explorer, navigate to "External Data" -> "Connections."
Click "Create connection," provide a name, select "Redshift" as the connection type, and enter the Redshift host, port, user, and password (or use Databricks secrets for credentials).
Alternatively, use the CREATE CONNECTION SQL command.

// Code:

    CREATE CONNECTION redshift_connection_name
    TYPE redshift
    OPTIONS (
      host '<redshift-host>',
      port '<redshift-port>',
      user secret('<secret-scope>', '<secret-key-user>'),
      password secret('<secret-scope>', '<secret-key-password>')
    );




B. Create a Foreign Catalog:
In Databricks Catalog Explorer, navigate to "External Data" -> "Catalogs."
Click "Create catalog," provide a name for the foreign catalog, select the previously created Redshift connection, and specify the Redshift database you want to mirror.
Alternatively, use the CREATE FOREIGN CATALOG SQL command.


//Code:

    CREATE FOREIGN CATALOG redshift_foreign_catalog_name
    USING CONNECTION redshift_connection_name
    OPTIONS (database 'redshift_database_name');




C. Grant Access: Grant necessary privileges (e.g., SELECT) on the foreign catalog, schemas, or tables to specific users or groups within Unity Catalog, just as you would for native Unity Catalog objects.

Querying Federated Data:
Once set up, you can query Redshift tables directly from Databricks using standard SQL syntax, referencing the foreign catalog, schema, and table names.


//Code:

SELECT * FROM redshift_foreign_catalog_name.redshift_schema_name.redshift_table_name;
