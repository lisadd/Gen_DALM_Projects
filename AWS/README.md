AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)
Develop and deploy applications with Boto3. The AWS SDK for Python makes it easy to call AWS services using idiomatic Python APIs.


Boto3 simplifies the use of AWS services by providing a set of libraries that are consistent and familiar for Python developers. All AWS SDKs support API lifecycle considerations such as credential management, retries, data marshaling, and serialization. The SDK is composed of two key Python packages: Botocore (the library providing the low-level functionality shared between the Python SDK and the AWS CLI) and Boto3 (the package implementing the Python SDK itself).

The AWS SDK for Python provides Python APIs for each AWS service. Using the SDK, you can build Python applications that work with Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, Amazon DynamoDB, and more The SDK is available as a semantically-versioned PyPI package.
