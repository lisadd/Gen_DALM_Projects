To query and analyze data using DAX in Microsoft Fabric, you will primarily use the DAX query view in the Power BI experience. DAX queries are typically used against a semantic model (dataset) that has already imported or connected to your data (e.g., from a Lakehouse or Data Warehouse). 



// Example Steps to Query Data with DAX:

1. Navigate to the Power BI Persona within your Microsoft Fabric workspace.

2. Select a Semantic Model: Locate the semantic model you want to query in the Data Hub or the workspace content list.

3. Open the DAX Query View: From the semantic model details page or the context menu, select the option to "Write DAX queries". In Power BI Desktop, this is a dedicated icon in the left-hand pane.

4. Write and Run Your Query: Use the DAX editor to write your query. All DAX queries for analysis must use the EVALUATE statement, which returns a table of results.

5. Analyze Results: Run the query and view the results in the integrated results pane. 

Example Code: Select, Filter, and Aggregate Data 

The following DAX query demonstrates how to select specific columns, filter the data for a certain product category and quantity, and aggregate sales amounts. 


EVALUATE
SUMMARIZECOLUMNS
(
    -- 1. Select / Group by columns
    'Date'[Calendar Year],
    'Product'[Category],
    'Geography'[Country],

    -- 2. Optional filters (applied to the entire result set)
    FILTER(
        VALUES('Product'[Category]),
        'Product'[Category] = "Clothing"
    ),

    -- 3. Measures/Expressions to aggregate the data
    "Total Sales Amount", CALCULATE(SUM('Sales'[SalesAmt])),
    "Total Quantity Sold (Filtered)", CALCULATE(
        SUMX(
            FILTER(
                'Sales',
                'Sales'[Quantity] > 5 -- Further filter condition
            ),
            'Sales'[Quantity]
        )
    )
)
ORDER BY
    'Date'[Calendar Year] DESC,
    "Total Sales Amount" DESC




// Code Breakdown:

- EVALUATE: The mandatory statement at the beginning of a DAX query that specifies the expression to be evaluated and returned as a table.
- SUMMARIZECOLUMNS: A powerful function used to group by specified columns and aggregate data using expressions or measures.
- Grouping Columns: We select [Calendar Year], [Category], and [Country] to break down the results by these dimensions.
- FILTER with VALUES: This part filters the entire evaluation context to only include rows where the [Category] is "Clothing".

// Aggregations (Measures):
- "Total Sales Amount" calculates the sum of [SalesAmt] for each group.
- "Total Quantity Sold (Filtered)" uses SUMX and FILTER to iterate through the Sales table and sum the [Quantity] only for sales where more than 5 units were sold in a single transaction, demonstrating a more complex, row-level filter within an aggregation.

ORDER BY: Sorts the resulting table by Year and Sales Amount for better readability.
