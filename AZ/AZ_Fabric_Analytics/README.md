DP-600:

Query and analyze data by using Structured Query Language (SQL), Kusto Query Language (KQL), and Data Analysis Expressions (DAX).

- Maintain a data analytics solution (25–30%)
- Prepare data (45–50%)
- Implement and manage semantic models (25–30%)


Maintain a data analytics solution (25–30%)

Implement security and governance
 - Implement workspace-level access controls
 - Implement item-level access controls
 - Implement row-level, column-level, object-level, and file-level access control
 - Apply sensitivity labels to items
 - Endorse items


Maintain the analytics development lifecycle
 - Configure version control for a workspace
 - Create and manage a Power BI Desktop project (.pbip)
 - Create and configure deployment pipelines
 - Perform impact analysis of downstream dependencies from lakehouses, data warehouses, dataflows, and semantic models
 - Deploy and manage semantic models by using the XMLA endpoint
 - Create and update reusable assets, including Power BI template (.pbit) files, Power BI data source (.pbids) files, and shared semantic models


Prepare data (45–50%)

Get data
 - Create a data connection
 - Discover data by using OneLake catalog and Real-Time hub
 - Ingest or access data as needed
 - Choose between a lakehouse, warehouse, or eventhouse
 - Implement OneLake integration for eventhouse and semantic models

Transform data
 - Create views, functions, and stored procedures
 - Enrich data by adding new columns or tables
 - Implement a star schema for a lakehouse or warehouse
 - Denormalize data
 - Aggregate data
 - Merge or join data
 - Identify and resolve duplicate data, missing data, or null values
 - Convert column data types
 - Filter data

Query and analyze data
 - Select, filter, and aggregate data by using the Visual Query Editor
 - Select, filter, and aggregate data by using SQL
 - Select, filter, and aggregate data by using KQL
 - Select, filter, and aggregate data by using DAX


Implement and manage semantic models (25–30%)

Design and build semantic models
 - Choose a storage mode
 - Implement a star schema for a semantic model
 - Implement relationships, such as bridge tables and many-to-many relationships
 - Write calculations that use DAX variables and functions, such as iterators, table filtering, windowing, and information functions
 - Implement calculation groups, dynamic format strings, and field parameters
 - Identify use cases for and configure large semantic model storage format
 - Design and build composite models

Optimize enterprise-scale semantic models
 - Implement performance improvements in queries and report visuals
 - Improve DAX performance
 - Configure Direct Lake, including default fallback and refresh behavior
 - Choose between Direct Lake on OneLake and Direct Lake on SQL endpoints
 - Implement incremental refresh for semantic models
