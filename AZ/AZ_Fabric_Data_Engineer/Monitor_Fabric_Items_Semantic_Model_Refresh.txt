Monitoring Microsoft Fabric items and semantic model refreshes can be accomplished using Python (via the SemPy library or REST APIs) or KQL/SQL (by leveraging the workspace monitoring logs stored in a KQL database or by querying the Warehouse/Lakehouse SQL endpoint DMVs). 

// Monitor Fabric Items using KQL/SQL 
You can enable workspace monitoring to store item job event logs in a dedicated Eventhouse KQL database, which you can then query using KQL or SQL. 

// Steps

1. Enable Workspace Monitoring: In your Fabric workspace, go to Workspace Settings, select the Monitoring tab, and turn on Log workspace activity. This automatically creates an Eventhouse and a read-only KQL database for logs.
2. Access the Logs: Navigate to the created KQL database. The logs are stored in tables like item job event logs.
3. Query the Logs: Use a KQL Queryset or connect via the SQL analytics endpoint to run queries. 

// KQL Example
This query retrieves recent job events, analyzes performance trends, and identifies failed jobs: 

// Base query to analyze semantic model refresh details and performance
// Requires 'Log workspace activity' to be enabled in Workspace settings
SemanticModelLogs
| where OperationName contains "Refresh"
| extend parsed_event = parse_json(EventText)
| project Timestamp, OperationName, Status = parsed_event.Status, Duration = parsed_event.Duration, ItemName = ApplicationContext.ItemName
| summarize count() by Status, bin(Timestamp, 1h)
| render columnchart



// SQL Example
For monitoring queries within a Fabric Data Warehouse, you can use built-in system views via the SQL analytics endpoint. 

-- Query the sys.dm_exec_sessions DMV to monitor current query activity
SELECT *
FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions
WHERE [status] <> 'idle';

-- You can also use Query activity to view historical T-SQL queries


// Monitor Semantic Model Refresh using Python 
You can use the sempy.fabric library within a Fabric notebook to programmatically list and monitor semantic model refresh requests. 

Steps
1. Open a Notebook: In your Microsoft Fabric workspace, create a new notebook or open an existing one.
2. Import Library: Import the necessary sempy.fabric library.
3. Monitor Refreshes: Use the list_refresh_requests function to get details on past and running refreshes.
