Power BI Service:




// Identify Patterns and Trends
- Visual Inspection: Use line charts to visualize data over time to see overall trends and specific fluctuations.
- Analytics Pane Trend Lines:
	1.Select a line, area, column, or scatter chart.
	2. In the Visualizations pane, select the Analytics pane (magnifying glass icon).
	3. Expand the Trend line section and select + Add line. Power BI automatically calculates and displays the statistical trend.
- Quick Insights: Right-click on a data point or an entire visual and select Analyze > Explain the increase/decrease to have Power BI automatically find and present insights and potential causes as a new visual. 


// Use the Analyze Feature in Power BI
- Explain Fluctuations:
	1.Right-click on a data point (e.g., a bar or line) in a visual.
	2.Select Analyze.
	3.Choose an option, such as Explain the increase, Explain the decrease, or Explain the difference.
	4.Power BI will run machine learning algorithms and display a window with a visual (like a waterfall chart) and a description detailing which categories most influenced the change. 


// Use Grouping, Binning, and Clustering
- Grouping (Manual):
	1.In a visual, select two or more data points (e.g., bars) using Ctrl+Select.
	2.Right-click one of the selected points and choose Group.
	3.A new group field will appear in the Fields list, which you can use in your visual to analyze the combined group.
- Binning (Defining value ranges):
	1.Right-click a numeric field in the Fields list.
	2.Select New group.
	3.In the dialog box, set the Bin size to place values into equally sized groups.
- Clustering (Automated ML):
	1.Create a scatter chart with the desired fields on the X and Y axes.
	2.Select the visual, then from the "More Options" menu (ellipsis), choose Automatically Find Clusters.
	3.Power BI applies machine learning to identify and group data points into a new "Clusters" field in the Fields list. You can adjust the number of clusters in the pane that appears. 


// Use AI Visuals
- Key Influencers: This visual helps understand the driving factors behind a key metric.
	1.Add the Key influencers visual to your report.
	2.Drag the metric you want to analyze into the Analyze field.
	3.Drag potential explanatory fields (dimensions) into the Explain by field.
- Decomposition Tree: This visual allows you to break down a metric across different dimensions to identify high and low contributors.
	1. Add the Decomposition tree visual.
	2. Add the main value you want to analyze to the Analyze field.
	3. Add the dimensions you want to use for explanation to the Explain by field. 


// Use Reference Lines, Error Bars, and Forecasting
- Reference Lines: Add constant lines, min/max lines, average lines, etc., from the Analytics pane in Power BI Desktop or Service.
- Error Bars:
	1. Select a line chart.
	2. In the Analytics pane, expand Error bars and turn them on.
	3. Add fields to the Upper bound and Lower bound fields to specify the range of uncertainty.

- Forecasting:
	1. Select a line chart with time series data (a date/time field on the X-axis).
	2. In the Analytics pane, expand Forecasting and turn it on.
	3. Adjust parameters such as Forecast length, Confidence interval, and seasonality to generate future predictions. 

Detect Outliers & Anomalies
- Anomaly Detection (Line Charts):
	1. Select a line chart that displays time series data.
	2. In the Analytics pane, expand Anomaly detection and select Add anomaly.
	3. Power BI automatically detects anomalies and provides explanations (root cause analysis).
- DAX Measures (Advanced): For more customized outlier detection (e.g., using IQR or Z-score methods), you can create specific DAX measures and use conditional formatting to highlight outliers in tables or visuals. 


// Manage and Secure Power BI (with Azure focus)
- Workspace Management:
	- Create and manage workspaces in the Power BI service to organize reports, dashboards, and semantic models, often aligning with Azure AD groups.


- Row-Level Security (RLS):
	- Define roles and rules within Power BI Desktop using DAX expressions to filter which data rows a user can see.
	- Manage these roles in the Power BI service and assign Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) users or groups to the defined roles.


- Azure Integration:
	- Use Azure services like Azure SQL Database or Azure Synapse Analytics as data sources for Power BI.
	- Leverage Azure AD for authentication and authorization.
	- Utilize Power BI Premium capacity, which uses Azure for computational resources and storage, for enhanced performance and enterprise features.
	- Implement Azure Private Link for secure data connectivity to Power BI (enterprise setup).
