DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a formula language used in Power BI to create calculated columns, measures, and calculated tables within a data model. Here are examples of DAX code for creating various model calculations:

Examples:

// 1. Creating a Measure (Aggregated Value):
Code

Total Sales = SUM(Sales[SalesAmount])
This measure calculates the sum of the SalesAmount column from the Sales table, providing the total sales figure.

// 2. Creating a Calculated Column (Row-Level Calculation):
Code

Full Name = 'Customers'[FirstName] & " " & 'Customers'[LastName]
This calculated column in the Customers table concatenates the FirstName and LastName columns with a space in between, creating a new Full Name column for each customer.


// 3. Creating a Measure with Time Intelligence (Year-to-Date Sales):
Code

YTD Sales = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]), DATESYTD('Calendar'[Date]))
This measure calculates the Year-to-Date (YTD) sales by summing the SalesAmount and applying a filter using the DATESYTD function on the Date column of the Calendar table.


// 4. Creating a Measure with Filtering (Sales for a Specific Product Category):
Code

Electronics Sales = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]), 'Products'[Category] = "Electronics")
This measure calculates the total sales specifically for products within the "Electronics" category by applying a filter on the Category column of the Products table.

// 5. Creating a Calculated Table (Summarized Data):
Code

Sales by Region = SUMMARIZE(
    Sales,
    Geography[Region],
    "Total Sales", SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]),
    "Average Order Value", AVERAGE(Sales[OrderQuantity])
)
